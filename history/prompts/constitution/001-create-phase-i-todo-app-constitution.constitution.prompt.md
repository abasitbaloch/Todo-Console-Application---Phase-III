## Prompt

```text
Project: Phase I – In-Memory Todo Console Application (Spec-Driven Development)

Purpose:
Build a Python-based command-line Todo application using Spec-Driven Development, where all code is generated by Claude Code from validated specifications. The application must demonstrate clean domain modeling, correct behavior, and adherence to AI-native development principles.

Core principles:
- Spec-first development (no code before specification approval)
- Deterministic behavior (same input → same output)
- Simplicity and clarity over cleverness
- Separation of concerns (domain logic vs I/O)
- AI-generated code only (no manual coding)

Key standards:
- All functionality must be defined in Markdown specifications
- Claude Code must be used for implementation
- No handwritten or manually edited source code
- Every feature must map to an explicit requirement
- Code must follow clean Python project structure
- All user interactions occur via terminal (CLI)

Functional requirements:
- Add Task: create a new todo with title and optional description
- View Tasks: list all tasks with ID, title, description, and completion status
- Update Task: modify title and/or description of an existing task
- Delete Task: remove a task by its ID
- Mark Complete: toggle a task's completed/incomplete status

Task rules:
- Each task must have a unique numeric ID
- Task title is required and must be non-empty
- Description is optional
- Completion status defaults to incomplete
- All data is stored in memory only (no files, no database)

CLI behavior:
- Present a clear menu of actions
- Accept user input safely (no crashes on invalid input)
- Display user-friendly confirmation messages
- Display errors clearly (e.g., task not found)

Technology constraints:
- Language: Python 3.13+
- Runtime: Local terminal (WSL2 required for Windows)
- Storage: In-memory data structures only
- Libraries: Python standard library only
- AI tooling: Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus

Project structure requirements:
- /src directory containing application code
- Constitution file defining project rules
- specs history folder containing all spec iterations
- README.md with setup and usage instructions
- CLAUDE.md with Claude Code execution guidance

Constraints:
- No persistence across runs
- No GUI or web interface
- No authentication or multi-user support
- No external APIs or databases
- No feature beyond Phase I scope

Success criteria:
- All five basic Todo features work correctly
- Application runs without errors
- All code is generated from specs via Claude Code
- Specs clearly describe behavior and constraints
- Codebase is readable, minimal, and logically structured
- Phase I deliverables meet hackathon evaluation standards
```

## Response snapshot

Created the Phase I Todo App Constitution (v1.0.0) defining six core principles:

1. **Spec-First Development**: No code before specification approval
2. **Deterministic Behavior**: Same input produces same output
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Domain logic separated from I/O
4. **AI-Generated Code Only**: All code via Claude Code from specs
5. **CLI-First Interface**: Terminal-only interactions, no GUI
6. **Simplicity and Clarity**: Simple solutions over clever ones

Added comprehensive sections:
- **Technology Stack**: Python 3.13+, standard library only, in-memory storage, manual testing
- **Development Workflow**: 6-phase process (Specification → Planning → Tasks → Implementation → Validation → Documentation)
- **Constraints**: Clear in-scope/out-of-scope boundaries
- **Governance**: Amendment process, versioning policy, compliance rules

Constitution template fully populated with:
- No remaining placeholder tokens
- Concrete rules for each principle
- Rationale for all design decisions
- Testable, enforceable requirements
- Version 1.0.0 ratified 2025-12-30

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Established project foundation and governance model for Phase I Todo App using Spec-Driven Development methodology
- 🧪 Tests: No tests (constitution is documentation, not code)
- 📁 Files: Created .specify/memory/constitution.md (v1.0.0)
- 🔁 Next prompts: "/sp.specify todo-app" to create feature specification based on constitutional principles
- 🧠 Reflection: Constitution successfully translates user requirements into enforceable governance. All six principles are concrete, testable, and aligned with AI-native development. Ready for specification phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - constitution creation successful on first attempt
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (no automated grading for constitution)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): baseline
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate constitution compliance during /sp.specify execution
