## Prompt

```text
Create: application architecture sketch, CLI interaction flow, domain model outline, and spec-to-code execution approach.
Decisions needing documentation: data model design, task ID strategy, CLI menu structure, error-handling approach, and in-memory storage choice with tradeoffs.
Testing strategy: manual CLI validation against acceptance criteria for each Todo operation.

Technical details:
- Use spec-driven execution (Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement)
- No manual code writing; all code generated by Claude Code
- Single-process, synchronous CLI application
- Separate concerns: domain logic, CLI I/O, and application control flow
- Use simple in-memory data structures (list/dictionary) for task storage
- Organize implementation steps by feature:
  Add Task → View Tasks → Update Task → Delete Task → Mark Complete
```

## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive task list for Todo Console Application with 50 tasks organized into 8 phases:

**Phase Structure**:
1. **Phase 1: Setup** (4 tasks) - Project initialization
2. **Phase 2: Foundational** (5 tasks) - Core domain model and infrastructure (BLOCKING)
3. **Phase 3: User Story 1** (8 tasks) - Add and View Tasks (MVP)
4. **Phase 4: User Story 2** (7 tasks) - Mark Tasks Complete
5. **Phase 5: User Story 3** (8 tasks) - Update Task Details
6. **Phase 6: User Story 4** (7 tasks) - Delete Tasks
7. **Phase 7: User Story 5** (3 tasks) - Exit Application
8. **Phase 8: Polish** (8 tasks) - Cross-cutting concerns and validation

**Task Organization**:
- All tasks follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- 50 total tasks (T001-T050)
- Tasks grouped by user story priority (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5)
- Each user story is independently testable after its phase completes

**Key Architecture Decisions**:
- **Domain Model**: `src/models/task.py` - Task entity with (id, title, description, completed)
- **Repository**: `src/repositories/task_repository.py` - In-memory storage with dictionary, auto-increment IDs
- **CLI Framework**: `src/cli/menu.py` - Menu display and input handling
- **CLI Handlers**: `src/cli/task_handlers.py` - Specific handlers for each operation
- **Entry Point**: `src/main.py` - Application loop and menu integration

**Separation of Concerns**:
- Domain logic (models, repositories) separate from I/O (CLI handlers)
- Repository handles data operations, CLI handlers handle user interaction
- Main entry point orchestrates menu and handlers

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- 4 tasks in Setup phase can run in parallel
- Repository methods for US1 (T010, T011) can run in parallel
- All user stories (US1-US5) can run in parallel after foundational phase
- 7 tasks in Polish phase can run in parallel
- Total parallel opportunities: 15+ tasks

**Dependencies**:
- Foundational phase (Phase 2) BLOCKS all user stories
- User stories (US1-US5) are independent of each other after foundational phase
- Each user story follows: repository methods → CLI handlers → menu integration → validation

**MVP Strategy**:
- Phases 1-3 deliver working MVP (Setup + Foundational + User Story 1)
- MVP provides add and view tasks functionality
- Each subsequent user story adds independent value

**Testing Strategy**:
- Manual CLI validation against acceptance criteria from spec.md
- Detailed acceptance testing checklists for each user story
- Edge case testing in Polish phase
- No automated test framework (per Phase I constraints)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete, executable task list ready for implementation with clear dependencies and parallel opportunities
- 🧪 Tests: Manual testing strategy defined with acceptance criteria checklists for each user story
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-todo-console-app/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: "/sp.implement" to execute tasks in order, or manual implementation starting with Phase 1
- 🧠 Reflection: Task generation successfully organized by user story priority, enabling independent implementation and testing. All tasks include specific file paths and follow strict checklist format. Foundational phase correctly identified as blocking prerequisite. Clear MVP path defined (Phases 1-3).

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - task generation successful, plan.md not required due to sufficient technical context in user input
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format validation PASSED (all 50 tasks follow checklist format with IDs, story labels where required, and file paths)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): baseline with direct technical context (bypassed plan.md requirement)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate that implementation phase correctly interprets task descriptions and generates appropriate code per constitution principles
