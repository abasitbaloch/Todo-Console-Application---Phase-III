## Prompt

```text
Phase I – In-Memory Todo Console Application

Target audience: Beginner-to-intermediate software engineering students learning AI-native, spec-driven development

Focus: Demonstrating how a simple domain (Todo management) can be fully implemented using specifications and AI-generated code without manual programming

Success criteria:
- All five basic Todo features function correctly via CLI
- User can manage tasks entirely through terminal interactions
- Each action produces clear, correct, and user-friendly output
- Application behavior matches the written specification exactly
- Code is fully generated by Claude Code from specs (no manual edits)

Constraints:
- Platform: Command-line interface only
- Language: Python 3.13+
- Storage: In-memory data structures only
- Libraries: Python standard library only
- Persistence: None (data resets on each run)
- Development method: Spec-Driven Development using Claude Code + Spec-Kit Plus

Not building:
- Web or graphical user interface
- Database or file-based persistence
- User authentication or multi-user support
- AI chatbot or natural language input
- Cloud, containerization, or deployment infrastructure
- Advanced Todo features (tags, priorities, reminders, recurring tasks)
```

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification for Phase I Todo Console Application with:

**Branch**: 001-todo-console-app
**Spec File**: specs/001-todo-console-app/spec.md

**User Stories** (5 prioritized stories):
1. P1: Add and View Tasks - Foundation feature delivering immediate value
2. P2: Mark Tasks Complete - Core satisfaction of checking off work
3. P3: Update Task Details - Maintain accurate information
4. P4: Delete Tasks - Cleanup and list maintenance
5. P5: Exit Application - Graceful termination

**Functional Requirements**: 23 requirements across four categories:
- Task Management (FR-001 to FR-008): Add, view, update, delete, mark complete
- Data Validation (FR-009 to FR-011): Title validation, ID validation, input handling
- User Interface (FR-012 to FR-018): Menu system, confirmations, error messages
- System Behavior (FR-019 to FR-023): In-memory storage, CLI-only, no external dependencies

**Key Entity**: Task (ID, Title, Description, Completed)

**Success Criteria**: 15 measurable outcomes:
- 10 operational metrics (timing, performance, crash-free operation)
- 5 educational demonstration criteria (AI-generated code, spec clarity, separation of concerns)

**Edge Cases**: 7 scenarios covering empty titles, invalid IDs, non-numeric input, invalid menu options, long strings, special characters, and empty list operations

**Assumptions**: Documented 6 key assumptions about user expectations, performance, and interaction model

**Out of Scope**: Explicitly excluded 15 features to prevent scope creep

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete, unambiguous specification ready for planning phase with zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- 🧪 Tests: Spec quality checklist passed all validation criteria (content quality, requirement completeness, feature readiness)
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-todo-console-app/spec.md and checklists/requirements.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: "/sp.plan" to create implementation plan based on this specification
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully balances educational goals with clear technical requirements. All constitution principles (spec-first, deterministic behavior, separation of concerns) are embedded in requirements. No clarifications needed due to well-defined problem domain and explicit constraints.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - spec creation successful on first attempt
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Spec quality checklist - ALL ITEMS PASSED
- Prompt variant (if applicable): baseline
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Validate that /sp.plan correctly interprets spec requirements and generates appropriate architectural decisions
